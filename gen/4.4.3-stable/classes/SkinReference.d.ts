 * See also `MeshInstance3D.get_skin_reference` and `RenderingServer.instance_attach_skeleton`.
 * Note that despite the similar naming, the skeleton RID used in the `RenderingServer` does not have a direct one-to-one correspondence to a `Skeleton3D` node.
 * In particular, a `Skeleton3D` node with no `MeshInstance3D` children may be unknown to the `RenderingServer`.
 * On the other hand, a `Skeleton3D` with multiple `MeshInstance3D` nodes which each have different `MeshInstance3D.skin` objects may have multiple SkinReference instances (and hence, multiple skeleton `RID`s).
