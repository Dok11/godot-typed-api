 * A `CubemapArray` without image data.
 * 
 * This class replaces a `CubemapArray` or a `CubemapArray`-derived class in 2 conditions:
 * - In dedicated server mode, where the image data shouldn't affect game logic. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.
 * - When the `CubemapArray`-derived class is missing, for example when using a different engine version.
 * 
 * **Note:** This class is not intended for rendering or for use in shaders. Operations like calculating UV are not guaranteed to work.
