 * Abstract base class for 3D particle attractors.
 * 
 * Particle attractors can be used to attract particles towards the attractor's origin, or to push them away from the attractor's origin.
 * Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is also supported.
 * Attractors can be temporarily disabled by hiding them, or by setting their `strength` to `0.0`.
 * 
 * **Note:** Particle attractors only affect `GPUParticles3D`, not `CPUParticles3D`.

 * The particle rendering layers (`VisualInstance3D.layers`) that will be affected by the attractor. By default, all particles are affected by an attractor.
 * After configuring particle nodes accordingly, specific layers can be unchecked to prevent certain particles from being affected by attractors. For example, this can be used if you're using an attractor as part of a spell effect but don't want the attractor to affect unrelated weather particles at the same position.
 * Particle attraction can also be disabled on a per-process material basis by setting `ParticleProcessMaterial.attractor_interaction_enabled` on the `GPUParticles3D` node.

 * 
 * **Note:** If `directionality` is greater than `0.0`, the direction in which particles are pushed can be changed by rotating the `GPUParticlesAttractor3D` node.
